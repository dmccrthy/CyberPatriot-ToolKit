<h2>Competition Scenario</h2>

<p>
You work for a new board game development company.
</p>

<p>
This company&#39;s security policies require that all user accounts be 
password protected. Employees are required to choose secure passwords, however 
this policy may not be currently enforced on this computer. The presence of 
any non-work related media files and &quot;hacking tools&quot; on any 
computers is strictly prohibited.  This company currently does not use any 
centralized maintenance or polling tools to manage their IT equipment. This 
computer is for official business use only by authorized users.  Your job is 
to secure this computer, within the guidelines of the scenario, while ensuring 
the availability of authorized business critical software and services.
</p>

<p>
Company policy states that Windows Action Center should be enabled and 
monitoring the security status of desktop Windows operating systems at all 
times.
</p>

<p>
This is a critical computer in a production environment. Please do <b>NOT</b> 
attempt to install Windows &quot;Feature Updates&quot; or &quot;Insider 
Preview Builds.&quot; Please do <b>NOT</b> attempt to use the Windows recovery 
options &quot;Reset this PC&quot; or &quot;Go back to an earlier build&quot;.
</p>


<h2>Windows 10 LTSC 2019</h2>

<p>
It is company policy to use only Windows 10 on this computer. Management has 
decided that the default web browser for all users on this computer should be 
the latest stable version of Firefox. Employees should also have access to the 
latest stable version of GIMP, Inkscape, and Tiled for company use. Any 
required software should not be installed using the Microsoft store.

Changing the password of a user that is set to automatically log in may lock 
you out of your computer.
</li>

<li>
Authorized administrator passwords were correct the last time you did a 
password audit, but are not guaranteed to be currently accurate.
</li>

<li>
Do not stop or disable the CCS Client service or process.

Do not remove any authorized users or their home directories.
